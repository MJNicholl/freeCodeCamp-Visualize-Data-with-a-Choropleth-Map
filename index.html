    <!-- TopoJSON CDN 
    TopoJSON is an extension from the GeoJSON which aims to remove redundancy in geospatial topological data
    such as common boundries between areas which are called arcs which are segments of paths.
    The data format in TopoJSON can look convoluted since it's focused in efficiency, losing readability
    hence the use of this CDN, to be able to convert TopoJSON to GeoJSON in order to draw projections -->
